Hey everyone , this is my personal "portfolio" webpage , nothing too special but it has some pretty stuff like :
* A sweet multi-layer parallaxed cityscape thing
* One cool CSS-only button
* Simple CSS tricks and bits

If you want to learn how to do any of these you can just ask me , or go ahead and fork the repo and play around if that's your thing :)
